# Excel-project
Payroll

MY TASK ON THIS PROJECT,

1. Form a company name and create employee names
2. Create an hourly wage and hours worked for a whole month, using January as the month
3. I am to use simple excel formulas to get how much the employees are paid in a month. also putting the extra hours worked for extra commission

WHAT WAS DONE
1. I invented some names and also gave them hourly wages.
2. Formatted the hourly wages with dollar signs
3. Calculated the pay by multiplying the time worked with the hourly wage
4. At the bottom of the sheet, I created a row for the max, min, average, and total hourly wage and hours worked of the month
5. Using the IF function, I calculated the overtime hours each employee worked to see those who are qualified for bonuses and then add to their pay
6. The overtime bonus was gotten by multiplying .5* hourly wage* overtime hours
7. Their total pay was gotten by adding their pay with the overtime bonus and then duplicating it for 4 weeks.
8. To get the 5 weeks in a month, I used the sum formula 1-Jan + 7 to get every week without typing
9. I colored the columns to easily identify the areas using the color filter
10. In order to calculate the pay, I kept referencing the hourly wage using the absolute cell referencing not relative that had been used throughout, using the $ sign before the cell
11. To get the total January pay, I added all the weeks together using the sum function
12. The person with the highest pay was Mann bill with a total pay of $30,780.00
